# FitCRUD-Gym-Management-Web-App# SignUpX : User Registration System with Java Servlets, JSP, and MySQL



# Problem Statement


Web applications often require a robust system for user registration to store user details securely and efficiently. Many registration systems struggle with issues such as poor form validation, a lack of database integration, and no feedback to users upon successful registration. This leads to user frustration and inefficient management of data.


## Project Overview:
 

The User Registration System is designed to allow users to easily sign up with their details, using Java Servlets and JSP for backend and frontend functionality, and MySQL to securely store user information. It provides real-time form validation, integrates with a database to store user data, and offers feedback to users on successful registration. The system is deployed on Tomcat 10.1, ensuring it is lightweight and scalable.

  
           
## Key Features:

   a) Simple Sign-Up Form: Users can create accounts by entering a username, password, and email.

b) MySQL Database Integration: User details are securely stored in a MySQL database with smooth data handling.

c) Form Validation: Ensures user input meets predefined requirements, enhancing both security and data integrity.

d) Java Servlets: Handles the form submission process, interacting with the database to store user information.

e) JSP for Feedback: Users receive immediate feedback upon successful registration through dynamically rendered pages.

f) Deployment on Tomcat 10.1: The application is hosted on a local server for efficient testing and deployment.



## Technical Highlights:


* Secure database connection using JDBC and MySQL.
* Proper validation for input fields like password strength and email format.
* Use of Java Servlets to handle HTTP requests and interact with the database.
* Clear feedback to users on successful or unsuccessful registration.
* A responsive and modern design using Materialize CSS for user interface styling.
