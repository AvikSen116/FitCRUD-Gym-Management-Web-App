# SignUpX : User Registration System with Java Servlets, JSP, and MySQL



# Problem Statement


Web applications often require a robust system for user registration to store user details securely and efficiently. Many registration systems struggle with issues such as poor form validation, a lack of database integration, and no feedback to users upon successful registration. This leads to user frustration and inefficient management of data.


## Project Overview:
 

The User Registration System is designed to allow users to easily sign up with their details, using Java Servlets and JSP for backend and frontend functionality, and MySQL to securely store user information. It provides real-time form validation, integrates with a database to store user data, and offers feedback to users on successful registration. The system is deployed on Tomcat 10.1, ensuring it is lightweight and scalable.

  
           
## üöÄ Key Features
- **Simple Sign-Up Form:** Users create accounts by entering a username, password, and email.
- **MySQL Database Integration:** User details are securely stored in a MySQL database with smooth data handling.
- **Form Validation:** Validates user input to ensure security and data integrity (e.g., password strength and email format).
- **Java Servlets:** Manages the form submission, interacting with the database to store user information.
- **JSP for Feedback:** Users receive immediate feedback on successful registration through dynamically rendered pages.
- **Deployment on Tomcat 10.1:** Application hosted on a local server for efficient testing and deployment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Highlights
- **Secure Database Connection:** Utilizes JDBC and MySQL to maintain secure and efficient data storage.
- **Input Validation:** Ensures proper formatting for email and password fields to enhance security.
- **Java Servlets for HTTP Handling:** Uses servlets to handle HTTP requests and interact with the database.
- **User Feedback Mechanism:** Provides clear feedback to users on registration success or failure.
- **Responsive Design:** Employs Materialize CSS for a modern, user-friendly interface.
